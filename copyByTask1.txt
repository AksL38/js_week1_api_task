QUESTION: DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COPY BY VALUE AND COPY BY REFERENCE

ANSWER:

             Variable is an identifier which points to particular memory address. When variable is referenced in a computation, whatever data is contained at that
 memory address is used for computation in place of that variable identifier. When one variable is assigned to another, if old variable is of primitive type like Number,
 String or Boolean then actual data at memory address is copied to new memory address pointed by new variable. This is called copying by value. But if old variable is 
 of composite type like array, object then new variable simply points to same memory address of old variable and they share same data in the memory. This is copying by
 reference.
 
            When new variable assignment consists of coppying by value, changing either old or new variable afterwards doesn't affect value of other as both would be
 pointing to different memory addresses. But when new variable assignment is by copying by reference, changing value of either old and new variable will affect the other
 as both variables point to same memory address. In a way copying by reference is not true copying but simply giving another name/alias to old variable.
